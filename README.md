**Internship C++ Tasks**

This repository contains various C++ programs developed as part of my internship assignments. The projects cover fundamental programming concepts such as control flow, functions, data structures, and user interaction.

**Projects Included :**
1) **Number Guessing Game**
A program that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it, providing feedback if the guess is too high or too low until guessed correctly.

2) **Basic Calculator**
A calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, running repeatedly until the user types exit.

3) **Tic Tac Toe Game**
A two-player console-based Tic Tac Toe game where players alternate turns to place X and O on a 3x3 grid, with win/draw detection.

4) **To-Do List Application**
A console-based task manager allowing users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.

**> How to Run :**

Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/sohamrajput98/Codsoft.git

Navigate into the project folder.

Compile the desired C++ file using a compiler like g++:
> g++ filename.cpp -o output

Run the executable:
> ./output

**Prerequisites :**

-> C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang.

-> Basic knowledge of using the command line.

**About Me :**

I am an aspiring C++ developer currently completing an internship at **#Codsoft** where I apply programming concepts through practical projects.
